## Lab Tasks  

### Task 1: Create Private GitHub Repository  
- Create a private repository on GitHub.

### Task 2: Connect Repository via SSH  
- Add your SSH public key to GitHub (`Settings > SSH and GPG keys`).  
- Clone your Lab2 repo using SSH.  

### Task 3: Configure Git Username and Email  
- Set up your Git identity (username & email).  
- Verify configuration.  

### Task 4: Explore the `.git` Folder  
- Explore the contents of the hidden `.git` folder.  

### Task 5: Local Repository Management  
- Re-initialize the local Git repository.  
- Add a `README.md` file and commit it.  
- Connect your local repo to GitHub and push changes.  

### Task 6: File Status & Staging  
1. Create a new file `notes.txt` and write a note.  
2. Check status.  
3. Stage and commit.  
4. Edit `notes.txt`, then repeat status/commit steps.  

### Task 7: Branch Creation Using GitHub GUI  
- Create a branch `bugfix/user-auth-error` on GitHub (web interface).  
- Pull the branch to your local repository.  

### Task 8: Branch Creation and Push Using Git Bash  
- Create a branch `feature/db-connection` using Git Bash.  
- Push the branch to the remote repository.  

### Task 9: Branching & Merging  
1. Create and switch to a branch `feature-1`.  
2. Modify `main.py` (add a function) and commit.  
3. Switch back to `main` and merge.  
4. Push all branches.  

### Task 10: Pull Request and Branch Review (GitHub GUI)  
1. Create a Pull Request from `feature/db-connection` to `main`.  
2. Review and merge the Pull Request using the GitHub GUI.  
3. Delete the `feature/db-connection` branch after merge.  

### Task 11: Detailed Branch Strategy (Develop/Staging)  
- Provide screenshots for:  
  - `branch_strategy.png` (branch list)  
  - `branch_merges.png` (merges into develop & staging)  
  - `final_merge.png` (final merge into main)  

### Task 12: Code Review Workflow  
- Create a Pull Request (PR) or Merge Request (MR).  
- Assign a reviewer → `pr_assigned_reviewer.png`.  
- Reviewer actions:  
  - Approve PR → `pr_approved.png`.  
- Merge PR:  
  - Confirmation → `pr_merge_confirm.png`  
  - Result → `pr_merged.png`  
- Branch Handling After Merge:  
  - If deleted → `pr_branch_deleted.png`  

### Task 13: Branch Cleanup Best Practices  
1. Delete remote branch after merge.  
   - GitHub UI → `remote_branch_deleted.png`  
   - Command line → `remote_branch_delete_cmd.png`
